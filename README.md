# Convolutional Neural Network
This is the code provided for Assignment 5 as part of Algorithm course. A Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is implemented on MNIST dataset which consists of images (28x28 size) and labels(classes).

# Requirements
The required libraries for the CNN impelementation are : 
- Tensorflow : used for deep learning or machine learning problems
- Numpy : used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations
- Matplotlib.plot : used for visualizations

# Model 
Three different CNNs models used, with 1 convolution layers and 3 layers which are 3,5 and 7.

# Test Accuracy 
Evaluate model by testing it for the test data set.

Test loss and accuracy for model with 3 layers

Test loss and accuracy for model with 5 layers

Test loss and accuracy for model with 7 layers


# Image and corresponding probability that are predicted right 

# Image and coressponding probability that are predicted wrong
